      <h1>Hello, are you [`human`,`robot`]?</h1>
      <p>
          "Hello, are you [`human`,`robot`]? explores how we interact with online interfaces. Sometimes these interactions are mandatory, requiring us to click “accept all cookies” or solve a CAPTCHA test before we proceed. We train ourselves to recognize these queries, speedily responding in order to get to the next interaction. These rules of behaviourism are programmed into us, just as robots are programmed with rules to execute the tasks they perform.
      </p><p>
  It is funny how we need to prove we are not a robot by performing robotic-like tasks. With a click, we send our data to an enigmatic network. As an award, we find the data of our interactions pops up elsewhere on the web in places we don’t always expect.
  </p><p>
  Hello, are you [`human`,`robot`]? playfully introduces the user to the notion the interactions we engage with might be “robotising” us. It hints at all the interconnected data we yield and the rewards we receive. Performing in this way, how human are we?"
