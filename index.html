      <h1>Hello, are you [`human`,`robot`]?</h1>
      <p>
        Hello, are you [`human`,`robot`]?  is an interactive artwork that reflects onto the interactions we have with interface elements on the web. Sometimes these interactions are mandatory due to regulations, such as the 'accept cookies' buttons. We have trained ourselves to recognise these queries, enabling us to respond with apt and ease interaction. These rules of behaviourism have been programmed into us, just as robots have been programmed with rules to execute the tasks that they perform.
      </p><p>
        It is funny how we need to tell that we are not a robot by performing robotic-like tasks. With a click we send our data to an enigmatic network. As an award we find the data of our interactions pops up elsewhere on the web.
      </p><p>
        Through a playful experience this artwork introduces the user to the notion of the interactions we engage in that might be 'robotising' us. In hints at all the interconnected data we thereby yield and what results in turn are rendered to us as rewards. What do the resulting compositions tell about the way we express our individualism in attempts to pose as a human-machine interface?
